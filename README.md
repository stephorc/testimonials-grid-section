## My process

### Built with

- Semantic & Non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of flex, grid, positioning w/ z-index, and sizing w/ media queries.

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on how to make optimal/seamless layouts, in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow, auto rows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44488357/equal-height-rows-in-css-grid-layout) - Stack Overflow is a lifesaver, especially in instances like this, where I forget how to keep rows the same size.
- [Stack Overflow, z-index positioning](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54417297/position-icon-at-the-top-right-corner-of-a-div/54417489) - This post helped me properly place the quotation mark svg in the corner of the first box.
- [CSS Tricks, svg sizing](https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/) - This post helped me properly size the quotation mark svg.
